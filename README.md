# Solar Energy Site Suitability Mapping using Satellite Data and Machine Learning

This project was completed as part of the **Winter in Data Science (WiDS)** guided project.

## Objective
To identify suitable locations for solar energy installations in Rajasthan, India using satellite data and machine learning techniques.

## Tools & Technologies
- Google Earth Engine
- Python
- Random Forest Classifier
- ERA5, SRTM, ESA WorldCover datasets

## Methodology
1. Satellite data preprocessing using Google Earth Engine
2. Feature extraction (terrain, land cover, wind speed)
3. Supervised machine learning using Random Forest
4. Generation of solar suitability maps

## Study Area
Rajasthan, India

## Results
The model identifies regions with high solar energy suitability that align well with existing solar installations.
